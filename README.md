# Pacman AI Game

Using the open source starter code from UC Berkley and University of Toronto AI courses, this project represents my implementation of an artificially intelligent multi-agent Pacman game in Python.  

In particular, it makes use of game-tree search techniques including optimized minimax, expectimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms to determine the behaviour of the agent.

## How to play it

### To play the Pacman game yourself type the following command: 
```
$python pacman.py
```
Use your keyboard's four arrows to move Pacman around.


### To watch Pacman play against a particular number of agents with each type of algorithm:

#### 
```
$python pacman.py -p <your-chosen-game> 
```
Your game options are as follows: MinimaxAgent, ExpectiMaxAgent, AlphaBetaAgent, GreedyAgent, ReflexAgent.


For other ways to play Pacman, check out the original UC Berkley and UofT AI courses: CS188 and CSC384.
